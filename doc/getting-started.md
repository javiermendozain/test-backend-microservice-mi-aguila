This project was build using:

- Node.js ( express )
- MongoDb ( mongosee as ODM )
- GitFlow
- Unit Testing ( Jest )
- Swagger ( Docs )
- Appnest/readme (Pretty readme ðŸ‘Œ)
- N-layers ( Model as design patterns )
- Docker compose

## Requirements

To run this project you must have the requirements installed on your machine.

- [ Docker ](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- [Docker compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

## Migration

To _migrate_ data Json to mongoDB you should go inside the container run:

```sh
docker-compose exec microservice-trips sh
```

And for migrate run:

```sh
npm run migrate
```

## Run Unit Test with Jest

You can try two ways

1.  In container, for to go inside run:

```sh
docker-compose exec microservice-trips sh
```

Inside of container run:

```sh
npm run test
```

2. In the project directory, you can run:

```sh
npm intall
```

```sh
npm run test
```
